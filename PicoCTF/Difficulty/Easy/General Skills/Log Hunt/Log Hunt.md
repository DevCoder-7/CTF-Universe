# Log Hunt

Author: Yahaya Meddy

Description:

Our server seems to be leaking pieces of a secret flag in its logs. The parts are scattered and sometimes repeated. Can you reconstruct the original flag?
Download the [logs](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_saffron_estate/3fd8e53ce77d299b70d2639d7837576e6347733c60cae69176906447add5a9c6/server.log) and figure out the full flag from the fragments.
