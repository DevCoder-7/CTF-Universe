# Crack the Gate 1

Author: Yahaya Meddy

Description:

We’re in the middle of an investigation. One of our persons of interest, ctf player, is believed to be hiding sensitive data inside a restricted web portal. We’ve uncovered the email address he uses to log in: ctf-player@picoctf.org. Unfortunately, we don’t know the password, and the usual guessing techniques haven’t worked. But something feels off... it’s almost like the developer left a secret way in. Can you figure it out?
The website is running [here](http://amiable-citadel.picoctf.net:54222/). Can you try to log in?
